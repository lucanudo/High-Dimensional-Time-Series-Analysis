# High-Dimensional-Time-Series-Analysis
The aim of the final evaluation is to apply some techniques of the course to some data sets.

You will have to use 'TaiwanAirBox.csv' (the second data set is completed with 'locations.csv').

A description of the first data set (resp. second data set) is given on page 221 (resp. pages 41-42) of the book "Statistical learning for Big Dependent Data" from Peña  and Tsay. These two data sets are also used subsequently in the book. Here is a link to download the book:

The instruction for the final exam is to present a talk of 15 minutes (followed by 10 minutes of questions) in which you will have to 

1) Apply a prediction technique to the time series.

2) Make a descriptive analysis of the series, their stationarity or non-stationary properties, their autocorrelations and cross-correlations (and possible interpretations). 

3) Identifying some profiles (e.g. clusters explaining common profiles).

It is not necessary to cover all these items, but the coherence of your talk will be evaluated. You can use a few slides and comment software outputs (with a preference for the software R).
